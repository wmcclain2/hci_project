            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to Jade Palace! We are a business resort located in PCB Florida that is dedicated to providing 
               an experience that you will never forget. Jade Palace is not your ordinary hotel or resort, in fact we go much further. We are pleased to announce that we are the first resort in the world that is designed solely for party goers. What this means is that our priority is to ensure that our visitors get the ultimate party experience. Some might even say we are a "club on the beach that you can sleep at". </p>

            <h2>Target Demographics</h2>
            <p>Our key demographic for this website are potential college spring break goers over the age of 21. Up to 500,000 students descend upon Panama City Beach each year for spring break. We intend to reach these potential customers by meeting their primary needs: a place to stay, and a place to party. This will also boost the marketability of the location, and help it take in a larger portion of  $170 million spent by students on spring break in PCB each year. The secondary group that this site will be catered toward is the parents who often fund their studentâ€™s trip. Safety is the primary concern for this customer demographic. By combining the location where the hotel and the partying take place there will be less concern for incidents of driving under the influence. The location will also be a more secure experience helping to prevent theft and other predatory practices.</p>
